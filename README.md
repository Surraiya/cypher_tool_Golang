# cypher_tool

This project encrypt and decrypt messages using various encryption techniques.


This cyphertool allowes to encrypt and decrypt messages using three different encryption techniques:

1. ROT13
ROT13 is encryption method that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter 13 positions down the alphabet.

2. REVERSE
Reverses character positions: first positioned character will be replaced with last one etc

3. 


EXAMPLE:
Enter the message:
abcd

Decrypted message using reverse:
zyxw


USAGE:
1. Enter message
2. Select the type of encryption
3. Encrypt message
4. Decrypt message
